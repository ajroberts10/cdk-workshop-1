# 1Ô∏è‚É£ Task 1 - Initialising our repo
The first thing for us to do is begin a new CDK project. Fortunately AWS make this really easy for us.

## cdk init
To initialise a new CDK repo, run the following:

```
cd [your-name]-workshop
cdk init app --language javascript
```

‚ÑπÔ∏è _We'll be going with javascript for this workshop but typescript is highly recommended for real projects!_

## What on earth is this doing?
Very simply, this creates a new project, all set up for CDK development. Let's have a look at a few of the key files and directories.

### üìÇ `bin/` directory
This is the entry point for your CDK application. You'll notice that it now contains a file with the same naming convention as your root folder:

`[your-name]-workshop.js`

This file is where you instantiate your CDK app and define the stack(s) you want to deploy.

### üìÇ  `lib/` directory
This directory contains our stack definitions. You'll see that `cdk init` has already created a stack template for us. How helpful!

`[your-name]-workshop-stack.js`

This file is where we will define our resources such as Lambda functions, API Gateway instances, S3 buckets etc.

### üìÇ `test/` directory
This directory contains our unit test files for our resources. Unit tests? For infrastructure? YES!

We'll look into this in a bit more detail in a later task.

### üìÑ `cdk.json`
This is the configuration file for the CDK CLI. It specifies how the CDK app should be executed (e.g entry point, context variables).

We probably won't touch this as part of this workshop but worth knowing about!

## Checklist
- [ ] Ran `cdk init` within our project directory
- [ ] Had a look at the created files

Now we're all set up, let's create our first resource!
