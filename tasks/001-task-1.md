# 1️⃣ Task 1 - Initialising our repo
The first thing for us to do is begin a new CDK project. Fortunately AWS make this really easy for us.

## cdk init
To initialise a new CDK repo, run the following:

```
cd [your-name]-workshop
cdk init app --language javascript
```

ℹ️ _We'll be going with javascript for this workshop but typescript is highly recommended for real projects!_
