# 6️⃣ Task 6 - Adding the Books endpoint
Alright, this is where I grab a cuppa and let you work your magic.

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to take all the knowledge we've just soaked up and create a shiny new endpoint called /books.

This endpoint will be our gateway to... drumroll, please... book data!

You can use the snippet below for your book data, or let your imagination run wild and come up with your own:

```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "title": "Pride and Prejudice",
    "author": "Jane Austen",
    "published_year": 1813,
    "genre": "Romance"
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "title": "Sense and Sensibility",
    "author": "Jane Austen",
    "published_year": 1811,
    "genre": "Romance"
  },
  {
    "id": 3,
    "title": "Adventures of Huckleberry Finn",
    "author": "Mark Twain",
    "published_year": 1884,
    "genre": "Adventure"
  },
  {
    "id": 4,
    "title": "The Adventures of Tom Sawyer",
    "author": "Mark Twain",
    "published_year": 1876,
    "genre": "Adventure"
  },
  {
    "id": 5,
    "title": "Song of Solomon",
    "author": "Toni Morrison",
    "published_year": 1977,
    "genre": "Fiction"
  },
]
```

Let's go through the tasks below:

- [ ] Create a new Lambda handler called "books.js"
- [ ] Create a new Lambda function in your stack
- [ ] Add appropriate tests for your Lambda function (don't worry about unit testing your handler)
- [ ] Add a new API Gateway route and hook it up to your newly created Lambda function
- [ ] Ensure your new route is using your API key for authorisation
- [ ] Add any appropriate tests for your new route
- [ ] cdk deploy your changes to AWS
- [ ] Access the AWS console to verify your resources have been deployed successfully
- [ ] Test your new API endpoint out using Postman, CURL or a tool of your choice

That wasn't so bad was it!

So that pretty much takes us to the end of this workshop in terms of creating stuff. We should now have a working application that looks a little bit like the following:

![Bookshop service](../images/bookshop-api.png)

That only leaves one thing left to do... tear it down!

Go to [Task 7](007-task-7.md)

## ℹ️ Useful Tip
If you run into any issues, you can refer to a completed version of the code to see how it should look at the end of this task.
