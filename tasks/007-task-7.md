# 7Ô∏è‚É£ Task 7 - Tearing down our stack
Let me tell you a cautionary tale about not following a workshop all the way through to completion...

I was following an online guide on how to provision EC2 instances using [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) (another nifty Infrastructure as Code tool). I got halfway through and successfully set up some EC2 instances with my newfound Terraform prowess. Cue the celebrations!

But, being me, I got distracted and didn't finish the guide, missing the crucial part about tearing down the stacks. Fast forward a month, and I was greeted with an AWS bill for the runtime of my EC2 instances. Oops!

‚ö†Ô∏è *Remember to always tear down any temporary stacks once you're done with them!... Just make sure not to touch the production ones!* üòÖ

## 7.1 - Destroying stuff

We have a few ways to tear down our stacks once we've finished with them. I'll describe the methods I use most frequently although I imagine there are more!

### cdk destroy

CDK offers us a simple way to tear down our stack. This will delete the CloudFormation stack and any associated resources.

To run this, we simply navigate to our project root directory and run:

```sh
cdk destroy MyStackName
```
Obviously replacing `MyStackName` with the name of your stack.

This will prompt you to confirm that you'd like to delete your stack. if you hit `y`, it will go ahead and delete your stack. This may take a few minutes.

You can confirm that the stack is no longer there by logging into the AWS console, navigating to the `CloudFormation` section and verifying that you can no longer see your stack.

### Deleting through the console

Another approach (and my preferred method) is to delete your stack directly through the AWS console.

To do this, navigate to the CloudFormation section in the console, select your stack using the radio buttons on the left, and click "delete".

I'll let you decide which method suits you best.

## Checklist

- [ ] Deleted your workshop stack

That brings us to the end of the workshop. Before we all go our separate ways, let's recap on a few things we've (hopefully!) learned.
