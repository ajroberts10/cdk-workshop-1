# 2️⃣ Task 2 - Creating a Lambda function
The first resource we'll create for our application will be a Lambda function and the associated handler code.

## Create the handler code
A Lambda handler is the entry point for an AWS Lambda function. It is the function that AWS Lambda calls to start executing your code whenever the function is invoked. The handler processes the event data passed to the Lambda function and typically returns a response or performs an action.

Let's go ahead and create a handler. Don't worry, we'll keep things simple for this workshop!

Within your project root `[your-name]-workshop/`, create a new `lambda/` directory:

```sh
mkdir lambda
```

Within this new directory, create a new file called `authors.js`

```sh
cd lambda
touch authors.js
```

Within this file, you can add the following code (we'll include some fake data as well):

```js
const authors = [
  {
    id: 1,
    name: "Jane Austen",
    genre: "Fiction",
    nationality: "British",
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    name: "Mark Twain",
    genre: "Fiction",
    nationality: "American",
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    name: "Toni Morrison",
    genre: "Literary Fiction",
    nationality: "American",
  },
];

exports.handler = async function (event) {
  console.log("request:", JSON.stringify(event, undefined, 2));
  return {
    statusCode: 200,
    headers: { "Content-Type": "text/plain" },
    body: authors,
  };
};
```


## Checklist
- [ ] Ran `cdk init` within our project directory
- [ ] Had a look at the created files

Now we're all set up, let's create our first resource!

Go to [Task 2](002-task-1.md)

## ℹ️ Useful Tip
If you run into any issues, you can refer to a completed version of the code to see how it should look at the end of this task.
